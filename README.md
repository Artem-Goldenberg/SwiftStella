#  SwiftStella

Parser and data structures library for working with 
the [stella](https://fizruk.github.io/stella/) language in Swift.

Code generated by the ANTLR for Swift is terrible... So this package provides a more
convinient interface to acess Stella's syntax constructions as well as the parser
built on top of the [SwiftParsec](https://github.com/davedufresne/SwiftParsec) 
library, which is a port of the original Haskell's Parsec library to Swfit.
